Task 0: Object-like Macro
Description: In this task, you need to create a header file named 0-object_like_macro.h that defines a macro called SIZE with the value 1024. This macro will serve as an abbreviation for the number 1024. You should then demonstrate its use in a program by adding 98 to SIZE and printing the result. This task helps you understand and use object-like macros in C.

Task 1: Pi
Description: In this task, you need to create a header file named 1-pi.h that defines a macro called PI with the value 3.14159265359. This macro will serve as an abbreviation for the mathematical constant Ï€ (pi). You should then use this macro to calculate the area of a circle with a given radius r and print the result. This task helps you understand and use macros for constants in C.

Task 2: File name
Description: In Task 2, you need to write a program that prints the name of the file from which it is compiled. This task doesn't require a header file. The program should output the name of the source file (e.g., 2-main.c) followed by a newline character. You'll use predefined macros to achieve this, helping you understand how to access information about the source file during compilation.

Task 3: Function-like Macro
Description: In this task, you need to create a function-like macro named ABS(x) that calculates the absolute value of a given number x. The macro should handle both positive and negative input values. You'll demonstrate its use by applying it to two different numbers and printing the results. This task helps you understand and use function-like macros in C.

Task 4: SUM
Description: Task 4 requires you to create a function-like macro named SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of two numbers, x and y. This macro should accept any integer values for x and y. You'll then use this macro in a program to calculate the sum of two specific numbers and print the result. This task reinforces your understanding of function-like macros in C.
