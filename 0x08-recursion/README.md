Task 0: Implement _puts_recursion, a function that prints a string followed by a new line using recursion.

Task 1: Implement _print_rev_recursion, a function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.

Task 2: Implement _strlen_recursion, a function that returns the length of a string using recursion.

Task 3: Implement factorial, a function that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion. Handle cases where n is less than 0.

Task 4: Implement _pow_recursion, a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion. Handle cases where y is less than 0.

Task 5: Implement _sqrt_recursion, a function that returns the natural square root of a number using recursion. Handle cases where the square root is not a natural number.

Task 6: Implement is_prime_number, a function that checks if a given number is prime using recursion.

Task 7: Implement is_palindrome, a function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion. An empty string is considered a palindrome.

Task 8 (Advanced): Implement wildcmp, a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if they can be considered identical, with the special character '*' in the second string indicating a wildcard match.
