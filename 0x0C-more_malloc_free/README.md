Trust no one:

Implement a function malloc_checked that allocates memory using malloc. If malloc fails, the function should cause the process to terminate with a status value of 98.
string_nconcat:

Create a function string_nconcat that concatenates two strings. The function should return a newly allocated space in memory containing the concatenated strings. It should also handle cases where n is greater than or equal to the length of the second string and when NULL is passed as a string.
_calloc:

Implement _calloc, a function that allocates memory for an array using malloc. The function should allocate memory for an array of elements, set the memory to zero, and return a pointer to the allocated memory. Handle cases where nmemb or size is zero and when malloc fails.
array_range:

Create a function array_range that generates an array of integers containing all values from min to max, inclusive. The array should be ordered from min to max. Handle cases where min is greater than max or when malloc fails.
_realloc (Advanced):

Develop a function _realloc that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free. It should copy the contents from the old memory block to the new one and handle various scenarios, including when new_size is equal to old_size and when ptr is NULL.
We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope (Advanced):

Create a program that multiplies two positive numbers provided as command-line arguments. The program should validate the arguments, ensuring they are composed of digits and handle any incorrect usage.
